P.S. This project holds a special significance for me as it was my first major endeavor in C# during my time as a second-year BSCS student. I completed it as part of my final term in the first semester, dedicating 2-3 weeks of hard work to its completion. While there are some known issues, rest assured that I am committed to resolving them promptly.
